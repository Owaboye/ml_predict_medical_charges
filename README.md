# Medical Insurance Charges Prediction — End-to-End ML Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the medical insurance charges for customers based on demographic and health data.  
We'll explore the data, preprocess it, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance — mimicking a real-world data science project.

## Business Problem
Accurate estimation of insurance charges helps insurance companies optimize premiums and assess risk profiles efficiently.
Our goal is to predict `charges` using features like `age`, `bmi`, `smoker`, and `region`.
